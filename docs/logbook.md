Today, I met with Dr. Tyson Swetnam and Dr. Tony Edgin to discuss the details of the internship. They introduced me to the CyVerse Data Commons, CKAN, and iRODS which are the main tools that I will be using for the internship. They explained that the goal of the project is to allow a researcher to upload their data onto the CyVerse Data Commons and then use the CKAN API to access the data. We also discussed the importance of prompt engineering in order to be able to generate helpful code. After the internship begins next week, we plan to meet every day in the morning for a few minutes to discuss the tasks that we accomplished the previous day and the tasks that we plan to accomplish that day. We also plan to meet every Friday for a longer period of time.
