# Logbook

[//]: # ([Daily Logs] -- short &#40;5-6 sentence&#41; summary of your daily activities that includes: &#40;1&#41; what was the plan?, &#40;2&#41; what actually happend?, &#40;3&#41; what could you have done better?, &#40;4&#41; how you will approach this differently next time? )

Note: The first five days in the logbook are from KEYS training week.

## Day 1 (6/3/24)

Started off the day with learning about science literacy, research posters, and scientific wriitng. Then, I learned the basics of command line and scripting with Dr. Hilgert.

## Day 2 (6/4/24)

Learned presentation skills and then how to create a poster in PowerPoint. After that, I learned about remote computing and then connected to the University of Arizona's HPC.

## Day 3 (6/5/24)

Learned the importance of responsible science and research communication and learned about machine learning from Dr. Greg Chism.

I also met with Dr. Tyson Swetnam and Dr. Tony Edgin to discuss the details of the internship. They introduced me to the CyVerse Data Commons, CKAN, and iRODS which are the main tools that I will be using for the internship. They explained that the goal of the project is to allow a researcher to upload their data onto the CyVerse Data Commons and then use the CKAN API to access the data. We also discussed the importance of prompt engineering in order to be able to generate helpful code. 

## Day 4 (6/6/24)

Learned how to use excel and visualize data with the help of Mollie Wiegand. Learned about statistics in a lecture given by Dr. Greg Chism. Then, I learned the basis of using R and RStudio as well as image analysis using ImageJ.

## Day 5 (6/7/24)

Discussed a research paper on science literacy with other interns. Attended a lecture on bioinformatics given by Dr. Uwe Hilgert. Attended a lecture on professionalism given by Kelle Hyland and completed the training week debrief and evaluation.

## Day 6 (6/10/24)

Today, I set up my OpenAI account so that I could practice prompt engineering. I watched some YouTube videos on prompt engineering and read through the [website](https://ua-data7.github.io/introllms/) provided by Dr. Swetnam.

[Here](prompt_engineering_examples.md) are some examples that I created.
